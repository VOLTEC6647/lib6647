Who is this library for?
========================

Any FRC team who may benefit from this library is welcomed to use it.
Giving us credit is optional, but greatly appreciated.
Feedback and suggestions may be given via `Github issues <https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647/issues>`_.

If you'd instead prefer a list of reasons to use this library, look no further.

You should use `lib6647 <https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647>`_ if...

- You are an FRC team using Java and are interested in implementing some of
  the top FRC teams' logic into your own robot.
  (`Team 195's improvements on Team 254's Loop subroutines <https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647/blob/master/src/main/java/org/usfirst/lib6647/loops/Looper.java>`_,
  `Team 254's 'lazy' Talon/Victor wrappers <https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647/blob/master/src/main/java/org/usfirst/lib6647/subsystem/hypercomponents/HyperTalon.java#L113>`_,
  etc.)

- You wish to reduce clutter in your code caused by having 
  `too many constants <https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2019-Public/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team254/frc2019/Constants.java>`_,
  `subsystem objects and their initialization <https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2019-Public/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team254/frc2019/subsystems/Drive.java>`_,
  or simply `too many subsystem/class instances <https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2019-Public/blob/master/src/main/java/com/team254/frc2019/Robot.java>`_.

- You're familiar with `JSON files <https://www.json.org/json-en.html>`_  and wish to use them in an FRC
  environment.

- You want to increase compatibility for your robot (allowing drivers to choose
  their preferred peripheral to control the robot), and not worry about
  declaring each individual button for every controller
  (see the `JController <https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647/blob/master/src/main/java/org/usfirst/lib6647/oi/JController.java>`_ class).

These are just some of the many reasons we ourselves use `lib6647 <https://github.com/VOLTEC6647/lib6647>`_,
and wish to share it with anyone interested.
